# Sownloader
Sownloader is the best Smule downloader available. It supports both audio and video, group songs and duets. Sownloader is being used by more than 100,000 people each month from all over the world. If you can't wait to download your performances, you can use our [Web version](https://sownloader.com) to download all your songs on your PC or mobile.


## Where are the versions prior to V9?
All versions before V9 are out of support and do not work anymore due to recent changes within the Smule API. This repository contains the first official version of Sownloader running on .NET instead of .NET Framework.
